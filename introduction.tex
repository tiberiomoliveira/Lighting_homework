This project is regarding the creation of a lighting design for a few interior five-a-side football pitches, also known as futsal. The design herein considers the specifications given by FIFA~\cite{www:fifa_official} and The~FA~\cite{www:the_fa_official} and attempts to respect them at its best. The football pitch's floor is made of timber and it has the official size determined by the FIFA's technical recommendation~\cite{www:fifa_book_spec}. The amount of light is specified by this document~\cite{www:the_fa_guide}, provided by The~FA's website.

The pitches are intended to be rented by private groups of people and it can also host a local competition. Therefore, this facility will be open from $7$AM until $11$PM every day, including during the holidays. People will circulate by foot on the floor, and the space is intended to be used only for futsal matches, even though the size and the required lighting can be shared with other types of gymnasium sports or other type of events. The level light required is $500\: lux$, this is the recommended level to accommodate local competitions and recreational futsal games, according to~\cite{www:the_fa_guide}. The facility's luminaires is used as plain power, because, even though there is some light entering onto the building through the windows, this amount of light is not so significant to be taken into account.
